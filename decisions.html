					<h1> Design Decisions</h1>
				<p>There were a number of design decisions that the team made. Throughout the redesign process, we had to focus on removing the unnecessary layers of navigation and information, while retaining the necessary content from the original page</p>
				
				<p>When we were initially devising the navigation of the homepage, we looked at different websites that, in our opinion, had great navigation and aesthetics. We discovered that most sites had two ways of navigating: by user and by type of information. But, we didn't want to confuse the user by placing too many types of main navigation. The solution we found in Boston University's site, which was an unobtrusive and subtle secondary navigation on top of the main one. The secondary navigation was by user type. This solved most of our navigation woes.</p>
				
				<p>The main difficulty was not in the actual aesthetics of the redesign; the original page was so cluttered that the choice was clear to make it more minimalist and less cluttered. Thus, our challenge lay in making sure the content of the page reflected the intention of the original, and not omitting any important and relevant information the user might need.</p>

				<p>For example, when we looked at the original contact page, there was no organization of the information. There were simply addresses, phone numbers, and department names in individual boxes all over the page. We had to find a way to unite the information in a way that was easy for the user to understand. So, we chose to list it by the type of service/person the user was trying to contact (individual, department, admissions, etc). In addition, we listed the main mailing address of the university. In the end, we chose to omit the mailing addresses as it cluttered the page too much. Instead, we added a direct link to the appropriate page, as well as easy access to the phone number (which the original page lacked).</p>
				
				<p>For the actual content of the homepage itself, we had a difficult time deciding what to include. The original homepage was very light in content, so it didn't provide much scaffolding for the redesign. In the end, we decided to include an image carousel (a non-functioning one in this mockup redesign) to showcase eye-catching images, a news section to highlight all the relevant news in athletics/research/student life, as well as an events section for quick access to campus events. </p>
				
				<p>In building the research page, most of the example websites we liked used a type of user centered organization (for students, for faculty, etc). It was hard to find this on the original content, so we decided to be minimal with the research page, and instead direct the user towards the already existing research page</p>
